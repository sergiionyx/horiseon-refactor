Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. code refactor

Made code refactoring for marketing agency.
	
Now a codebase follows accessibility standards so website is optimized for search engines.

Changed html and css files:
	- rewrited and added semantic HTML elements;
	- moved the elements so they follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning;
	- added alt attributes to the image elements;
	- corrected heading attributes they fall in sequential order;
	- changed the title element, so it get look of a concise, descriptive title;
	- fixed all links so they are functioning correctly;
	- included comments before each element and section of the page.
